# CoincallTrader Architecture & Development Plan

**Version:** 1.9  
**Date:** February 24, 2026  
**Status:** Phase 5 (Strategy Layer) + Phase 1–2 Hardening (48-Hour Reliability)

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transformation of CoincallTrader from a simple options trading bot into a comprehensive, multi-instrument trading management system capable of running complex, time-aware strategies while maintaining code elegance and manageability.

---

## Current State (Phase 5 complete)

### Implemented
- ✅ **Authentication** — HMAC-SHA256 signing (`auth.py`), JSON + form-urlencoded
- ✅ **Configuration** — Environment switching via `.env`, strategy params in code (`config.py`)
- ✅ **Market data** — Option chains, orderbooks, BTC price, option details (`market_data.py`)
- ✅ **Option selection** — Expiry/strike/delta filtering + `LegSpec` declarative resolution + compound `find_option()` with multi-constraint support + **DTE-based expiry** (`option_selection.py`)
- ✅ **Structure templates** — `straddle()`, `strangle()` → return `List[LegSpec]` for plug-in to `StrategyConfig` (`option_selection.py`)
- ✅ **Order execution** — Limit orders, get/cancel/status queries (`trade_execution.py`)
- ✅ **RFQ execution** — Block trades for $50k+ notional multi-leg structures; **orderbook comparison fix** (correct side selection for buy/sell, unified improvement formula) (`rfq.py`)
- ✅ **Smart orderbook execution** — Chunked quoting with aggressive fallback (`multileg_orderbook.py`)
- ✅ **Trade lifecycle** — State machine (PENDING_OPEN → … → CLOSED), exit conditions, multi-leg native (`trade_lifecycle.py`)
- ✅ **Exit conditions** — `profit_target`, `max_loss`, `max_hold_hours`, **`time_exit`** (absolute clock), **`utc_datetime_exit`** (specific datetime), `account_delta_limit`, `structure_delta_limit`, `leg_greek_limit` (`trade_lifecycle.py`, `strategy.py`)
- ✅ **Position monitoring** — Background polling, `AccountSnapshot`/`PositionSnapshot`, live Greeks (`account_manager.py`)
- ✅ **Strategy framework** — `TradingContext` DI, `StrategyConfig`, `StrategyRunner`, 7 entry condition factories, dry-run mode (`strategy.py`)
- ✅ **Strategy lifecycle** — `max_trades_per_day` gate, `on_trade_closed` callback, `stats` property (`strategy.py`)
- ✅ **Scheduling** — `time_window()`, `utc_time_window()`, `weekday_filter()` as entry conditions; `utc_datetime_exit()` for precise close scheduling
- ✅ **Account info** — Equity, available margin, IM/MM amounts, margin utilisation, aggregated Greeks
- ✅ **Logging** — File + console logging to `logs/trading.log` (audit trail)
- ✅ **Phase 1 Hardening** — Request timeouts (30s), @retry decorator with exponential backoff (1-2-4s), main loop error isolation (max 10 consecutive errors before exit) (`auth.py`, `retry.py`, `main.py`)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Reliability** — Market data caching with 30s TTL & max 100 entries (`market_data.py`), trade state persistence to `logs/trade_state.json` every 60s for crash recovery (`persistence.py`), background health check logging every 5 minutes (`health_check.py`), fixed `max_concurrent_trades=2` for daily rolling positions

## Target Architecture

### Design Principles
1. **Composition over inheritance** — Callable conditions, not class hierarchies
2. **Dataclasses everywhere** — Simple, typed data containers
3. **Single responsibility** — Each module does one thing well
4. **Configuration-driven** — Strategies defined as data (`StrategyConfig`), not hardcoded
5. **Tick-driven core** — `PositionMonitor` drives `StrategyRunner.tick()` — no event queues or extra threads
6. **Fail-safe defaults** — Conservative behavior when uncertain
7. **Flat file structure** — One module per concern; add packages only when complexity demands it

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Cleanup — SUPERSEDED

Originally planned an event-queue architecture (`core/events.py`, `core/event_queue.py`).  
This was replaced by the simpler **tick model**: `PositionMonitor.on_update()` drives `StrategyRunner.tick()` — no event queue, no extra threads, no scheduler dependency. Design principles 1–4 and 6 are followed; principle 5 (event-driven) was intentionally swapped for the tick-driven approach.

---

### Phase 1: RFQ Execution ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 9, 2026)
**Goal:** Enable RFQ-based execution for multi-leg options trades.

**Implementation Summary:**
Created `rfq.py` module (~800 lines) with complete RFQ lifecycle management.

**Key Classes:**
- `OptionLeg` - Dataclass for leg definition (instrument, side, qty)
- `RFQQuote` - Quote from market maker with `is_we_buy`/`is_we_sell` properties
- `RFQResult` - Execution result with success, total_cost, improvement_pct
- `RFQExecutor` - Main executor with `execute(legs, action='buy'|'sell')`

**Key Learnings:**
1. Legs specify their own `side` ("BUY" or "SELL") — spreads have both; the API does not require all legs to be BUY
2. Market makers respond with two-way quotes (both BUY and SELL)
3. Quote `side` indicates MM's action: `MM SELL` = we buy, `MM BUY` = we sell
4. Accept/Cancel endpoints require `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type
5. Minimum notional: $50,000 (sum of strike values)
6. Quotes typically arrive within 3-5 seconds

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /open/option/blocktrade/request/create/v1` (JSON)
- `GET /open/option/blocktrade/request/getQuotesReceived/v1`
- `POST /open/option/blocktrade/request/accept/v1` (form-urlencoded)
- `POST /open/option/blocktrade/request/cancel/v1` (form-urlencoded)

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `rfq.py` - Complete RFQ execution module
- [x] `tests/test_rfq_integration.py` - Integration tests
- [x] Updated `auth.py` with `use_form_data` support
- [x] Updated `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` with RFQ documentation

---

### Phase 2: Position Monitoring & Trade Lifecycle ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 10, 2026)
**Goal:** Monitor positions with live Greeks, and orchestrate trades through their full lifecycle (open → manage → close).

**Implementation Summary:**

**Part A: Position Monitoring** (added to `account_manager.py`):
- `PositionSnapshot` — frozen dataclass for a single position (Greeks, PnL, mark price)
- `AccountSnapshot` — frozen dataclass for full account state (equity, margins, aggregated Greeks)
- `PositionMonitor` — background polling with thread-safe snapshot access and callbacks
- Uses `upnlByMarkPrice` / `roiByMarkPrice` for accurate options PnL

**Part B: Trade Lifecycle** (new file `trade_lifecycle.py`):
- `TradeState` enum: PENDING_OPEN → OPENING → OPEN → PENDING_CLOSE → CLOSING → CLOSED | FAILED
- `TradeLeg` — tracks a single leg from intent through order, fill, and position
- `TradeLifecycle` — groups legs into a trade with exit conditions and execution mode
- `LifecycleManager` — state machine that advances trades via `tick()` callback
  - Supports "limit" mode (per-leg orders via TradeExecutor) and "rfq" mode (atomic via RFQExecutor)
  - `tick()` hooks into PositionMonitor.on_update() for automatic advancement
  - `force_close()` and `cancel()` for manual intervention

**Exit Condition System:**
Exit conditions are callables `(AccountSnapshot, TradeLifecycle) -> bool`.
Factory functions provided for common patterns:
- `profit_target(pct)` — structure PnL as % of entry cost
- `max_loss(pct)` — structure loss limit
- `max_hold_hours(hours)` — time-based exit
- `account_delta_limit(threshold)` — account-level Greek limit
- `structure_delta_limit(threshold)` — structure-level Greek limit
- `leg_greek_limit(leg_index, greek, op, value)` — per-leg Greek threshold
- Custom lambdas/functions for anything else

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. Flat architecture — no Portfolio/Account wrapper classes; lifecycle IS the trade
2. Callable exit conditions instead of Strategy ABC — composable, testable, no class hierarchy
3. `tick()` model — driven by PositionMonitor, no extra threads or event queues
4. Multi-leg native — Iron Condor = one lifecycle with 4 legs

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `PositionSnapshot`, `AccountSnapshot`, `PositionMonitor` in `account_manager.py`
- [x] `trade_lifecycle.py` — TradeState, TradeLeg, TradeLifecycle, LifecycleManager
- [x] Exit condition factories (profit, loss, time, Greeks at all levels)
- [x] `tests/test_position_monitor.py` — position monitoring integration test
- [x] `tests/test_trade_lifecycle.py` — lifecycle dry-run and live test

### Phase 3: Smart Orderbook Execution ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 13, 2026)
**Goal:** Enable smart multi-leg orderbook execution with chunking, continuous quoting, and aggressive fallback for trades below RFQ minimum ($50k notional).

**Implementation Summary:**

**Module:** `multileg_orderbook.py` (~1000 lines)

**Core Algorithm:**
1. **Chunk Calculation** — Split total order into N proportional chunks (e.g., 0.4 contracts → 2 chunks of 0.2 each, maintaining leg ratios)
2. **Position-Aware Tracking** — Track delta from starting position using `abs(current - starting)` to handle:
   - Opens: Starting=0.0, Target=0.2 → fill delta 0.2
   - Closes: Starting=0.2, Target=0.2 → fill delta 0.2 (position goes to 0)
3. **Per-Chunk Execution:**
   - **Phase A (Quoting):** Place limit orders at calculated prices for `time_per_chunk` seconds
     - Continuous repricing every `reprice_interval` seconds (min 10s)
     - Cancel and reprice when market moves beyond `reprice_price_threshold`
     - Stop quoting legs individually as they fill (others continue)
   - **Phase B (Aggressive Fallback):** If not filled, use aggressive limit orders crossing the spread
     - Multiple retry attempts with configurable wait times
     - Exits early when all legs filled
4. **Early Termination** — Between chunks, check if target already reached and stop processing remaining chunks

**Key Classes:**
- `SmartExecConfig` — Configuration with 12+ parameters (chunk_count, time_per_chunk, quoting_strategy, etc.)
- `LegChunkState` — Per-leg state within a chunk (filled_qty, starting_position, remaining_qty, is_filled)
- `ChunkState` — State machine for chunk execution (QUOTING → FALLBACK → COMPLETED)
- `SmartExecResult` — Execution summary (success, chunks_completed, fills, costs, fallback_count)
- `SmartOrderbookExecutor` — Main executor class integrating with TradeExecutor and AccountManager

**Quoting Strategies:**
- `"top_of_book"` — Use orderbook bid/ask directly
- `"top_of_book_offset_pct"` — Offset from top by spread_pct (e.g., ±0.5%)
- `"mid"` — Use (bid + ask) / 2
- `"mark"` — Use mark price (fallbacks to mid if unavailable)

**Critical Fixes During Development:**
1. **Close Detection Bug** — Changed fill tracking from `max(0.0, current - starting)` to `abs(current - starting)` 
   - Without this, closes would return negative deltas clamped to 0
   - Algorithm would think nothing filled and loop indefinitely
   - Fix enabled both opens (0→0.1) and closes (0.2→0.1) to be tracked correctly

**Integration with LifecycleManager:**
- Opening trades: Uses `LifecycleManager.create()` with `execution_mode="smart"` and `smart_config`
- Closing trades: Currently direct call to `SmartOrderbookExecutor.execute_smart_multi_leg()` 
  - LifecycleManager doesn't yet support smart close mode (future enhancement)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Butterfly spread (3 legs, different quantities: 0.2/0.4/0.2)
  - Opening: 57.1s execution, 100% fills, 2 chunks
  - Closing: 65.4s execution, 100% fills, 2 chunks, positions fully closed
- ✅ Proportional chunking maintains leg ratios
- ✅ Mid-price quoting reduces slippage vs aggressive orders
- ✅ Early termination when fills complete
- ✅ Handles both increasing positions (opens) and decreasing positions (closes)

**Configuration Example:**
```python
smart_config = SmartExecConfig(
    chunk_count=2,              # Split into 2 chunks
    time_per_chunk=20.0,        # 20 seconds per chunk
    quoting_strategy="mid",     # Quote at mid-price
    reprice_interval=10.0,      # Reprice every 10s
    reprice_price_threshold=0.1,# Reprice if price moves >0.1
    min_order_qty=0.01,         # Minimum order size
    aggressive_attempts=10,     # Max fallback attempts
    aggressive_wait_seconds=5.0,# Wait 5s per attempt
    aggressive_retry_pause=1.0  # 1s between attempts
)
```

**API Integration:**
- Uses TradeExecutor for order placement/cancellation (limit orders)
- Uses AccountManager for position polling (fill detection)
- Uses market_data.get_option_orderbook() for pricing

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `multileg_orderbook.py` — Complete smart execution module
- [x] `tests/test_smart_butterfly.py` — Full lifecycle test (open + close)
- [x] `tests/close_butterfly_now.py` — Emergency close utility
- [x] Position-aware fill tracking for opens and closes
- [x] Comprehensive logging and execution reporting

---

### Phase 4: Strategy Framework ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 14, 2026)
**Goal:** Enable declarative, config-driven strategy definitions with composable entry/exit conditions, dependency injection, and dry-run mode.

**Implementation Summary:**

**New Module:** `strategy.py` (~578 lines)

**Core Classes:**
- `TradingContext` — Dependency injection container holding every service (auth, market data, executor, RFQ, smart executor, account manager, position monitor, lifecycle manager). Strategies and tests receive this instead of importing globals.
- `StrategyConfig` — Declarative strategy definition: legs (`LegSpec` list), entry conditions, exit conditions, execution mode, concurrency limits, cooldown, and dry-run flag.
- `StrategyRunner` — Tick-driven executor: checks entry conditions, resolves `LegSpec`s to concrete symbols via `resolve_legs()`, creates trade lifecycles, delegates to `LifecycleManager`.
- `build_context()` — Factory function that wires all services from `config.py` settings.

**Entry Condition Factories:**
| Factory | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `time_window(start, end)` | UTC hour window (e.g., 8–20) |
| `weekday_filter(days)` | Day-of-week filter (e.g., Mon–Thu) |
| `min_available_margin_pct(pct)` | Minimum free margin % |
| `min_equity(usd)` | Minimum account equity |
| `max_account_delta(limit)` | Account delta threshold |
| `max_margin_utilization(pct)` | IM/equity ceiling |
| `no_existing_position_in(symbols)` | Block if already positioned |

**Modified Module:** `option_selection.py` — Added:
- `LegSpec` dataclass — declares option_type, side, qty, strike_criteria, expiry_criteria, underlying
- `resolve_legs()` — converts `list[LegSpec]` to `list[TradeLeg]` by querying market data

**Modified Module:** `trade_lifecycle.py` — Added:
- `strategy_id` field on `TradeLifecycle` for per-strategy tracking
- `_get_orderbook_price()` helper for live pricing
- `get_trades_for_strategy()` and `active_trades_for_strategy()` on `LifecycleManager`

**Modified Module:** `trade_execution.py` — Fixed:
- `get_order_status()` endpoint: `/open/option/order/singleQuery/v1?orderId={id}`
- `cancel_order()` sends orderId as `int()` per API spec
- Fill field: `fillQty` (was `executedQty`), state 3 = CANCELED (was 4)

**Modified Module:** `main.py` — Rewritten:
- Uses `build_context()` for service wiring
- Registers `StrategyRunner` instances on `PositionMonitor.on_update()`
- Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) for graceful shutdown

**Dry-Run Mode:**
- `StrategyConfig(dry_run=True)` enables simulated execution
- Uses `get_option_details()` for live pricing without placing orders
- Logs entry/exit prices, estimated PnL, and position details
- Full lifecycle reporting with `_execute_dry_run()`

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. No Strategy ABC — strategies are `StrategyConfig` data, not class hierarchies
2. Entry conditions mirror exit conditions — both `Callable[[AccountSnapshot, ...], bool]`
3. `resolve_legs()` decouples leg specification from symbol resolution
4. DI container enables testing with mock services
5. `StrategyRunner.tick()` is registered on PositionMonitor — no extra threads

**Testing Results:**
- Tests 1–7 (unit): 72/72 assertions passed
  - Config validation, context building, entry condition logic, LegSpec/resolve_legs, runner lifecycle, dry-run mode, edge cases
- Test 8a (integration dry-run): 11/11 passed — live pricing, no orders
- Test 8b (integration micro-trade): 16/16 passed — full lifecycle: opening → open → pending_close → closing → closed in 11.3s

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `strategy.py` — TradingContext, StrategyConfig, StrategyRunner, entry conditions, build_context()
- [x] `option_selection.py` updates — LegSpec dataclass, resolve_legs(), find_option() compound selection
- [x] `trade_lifecycle.py` updates — strategy_id, _get_orderbook_price(), per-strategy queries
- [x] `trade_execution.py` fixes — correct endpoint, field names, state codes
- [x] `main.py` rewrite — DI wiring, strategy registration, signal handling
- [x] `tests/test_strategy_framework.py` — 72/72 unit test assertions
- [x] `tests/test_live_dry_run.py` — 27/27 integration test assertions
- [x] `tests/test_complex_option_selection.py` — 32/32 compound option selection assertions
- [x] Workspace cleanup — 6 legacy files moved to archive/

---

### Phase 4.5: RFQ Comparison Fix + Endurance Testing ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 23, 2026)
**Goal:** Fix critical bug in RFQ orderbook comparison and validate with live market data.

**Bug Description:**
`get_orderbook_cost()` always used `leg.side` to determine ask/bid, but for simple structures (strangles) all legs have `side="BUY"`. When `action="sell"`, it should check bids (what we'd receive), not asks. This made sell-side orderbook comparison meaningless — reporting +180% "improvement" because it was comparing against the wrong side of the book.

**Fixes Applied to `rfq.py`:**
1. **`get_orderbook_cost(legs, action="buy")`** — Added `action` parameter. Computes `effectively_buying = (leg.side == "BUY") == want_to_buy` to select correct orderbook side (ask for buying, bid for selling).
2. **`calculate_improvement()`** — Unified to single formula `(orderbook - quote) / |orderbook| * 100` for both directions. Was previously inverted for sell side.
3. **`execute()`** — Passes `action=action` through to `get_orderbook_cost()`.

**Additional Changes:**
- `_close_rfq()` docstring in `trade_lifecycle.py` — removed stale "legs as BUY" comment
- Added `utc_time_window()` entry condition and `utc_datetime_exit()` exit condition to `strategy.py`
- Created `strategies/rfq_endurance.py` — 3-cycle endurance test strategy

**Validation Results:**
- Strangle: BUY quotes +0 to +4%, SELL quotes +7 to +14% (was +180%)
- Iron condor (mixed BUY/SELL legs): BUY +2 to +5.5%, SELL +6.2 to +6.3%
- 3-cycle endurance test: all cycles completed, clean shutdown

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Fixed `get_orderbook_cost()`, `calculate_improvement()`, `execute()` in `rfq.py`
- [x] Fixed stale docstrings in `trade_lifecycle.py`
- [x] `utc_time_window()` and `utc_datetime_exit()` in `strategy.py`
- [x] `strategies/rfq_endurance.py` — endurance test strategy
- [x] `tests/test_rfq_comparison.py` — strangle RFQ quote monitoring
- [x] `tests/test_rfq_iron_condor.py` — iron condor RFQ quote monitoring

### Phase 5: Multi-Instrument Support (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Extend trading to futures and spot markets.

**Approach:** Extend existing flat modules rather than creating a `data/` package.

**Tasks:**
1. Add futures methods to `market_data.py` and `trade_execution.py`:
   - `get_futures_instruments()`, `get_futures_orderbook(symbol)`
   - `place_futures_order()`, `get_futures_positions()`
2. Add spot methods similarly
3. Extend `LegSpec` to support non-option instruments

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /open/futures/market/instruments/v1`
- `POST /open/futures/order/create/v1`
- `GET /open/spot/market/instruments`
- `POST /open/spot/trade/order/v1`

**Deliverables:**

### Phase 6: Account Alerts & Monitoring (1 day)
**Goal:** Add proactive alerting on top of the existing `AccountSnapshot` infrastructure.

**Already done:**
- `AccountSnapshot` with equity, available_margin, IM, MM, margin_utilisation, aggregated Greeks
- Entry conditions: `min_available_margin_pct()`, `max_margin_utilization()`, `min_equity()`

**Remaining tasks:**
1. Margin alert system (email, webhook, or Telegram notifications)
2. Wallet holdings per asset (`GET /open/account/wallet/v1`)
3. Historical P&L tracking

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Alert notification system
- [ ] Wallet holdings integration
- [ ] P&L history logging

---

### Phase 7: Web Dashboard (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Create a simple web interface for monitoring.

**Tasks:**
1. Create FastAPI app (`dashboard.py` or `dashboard/` package):
   - `GET /` - Dashboard home
   - `GET /api/strategies` - Running strategies
   - `GET /api/positions` - Current positions
   - `GET /api/account` - Account info
   - `GET /api/logs` - Recent log entries

2. Simple HTML template with auto-refresh

3. Optional: Add authentication for remote access

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Dashboard app
- [ ] HTML templates
- [ ] Basic CSS styling

---

### Phase 8: Persistence & Recovery (1-2 days)
**Goal:** Enable queryable state persistence and crash recovery beyond current file logging.

**Already done:**
- All trades, orders, and state transitions logged to `logs/trading.log`
- `LifecycleManager` tracks all trades in memory during runtime

**Remaining tasks:**
1. Create SQLite backend for structured persistence:
   - Trade lifecycles (state, legs, timestamps)
   - Order history (order_id, fill_price, fill_qty)
   - Strategy state (last run, cooldown, active trades)
2. Startup recovery:
   - Load persisted trades on restart
   - Reconcile with exchange position state
   - Resume StrategyRunners

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `persistence.py` — SQLite read/write
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] Startup recovery logic in `main.py`

## Open Questions

1. **Persistence format:** SQLite vs JSON files vs something else?
2. **Dashboard auth:** Simple password vs OAuth vs VPN-only access?
3. **Concurrent strategies:** Expected to run 2-3 or 10+?
4. **Deployment target:** VPS, local machine, cloud?
5. **Backtesting:** Is this a future requirement?
